<h1>Hi there, I'm Elkana Baris!</h1>
<p>I'm a Grad Student\Machine Learning Reasercher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and also a Data Scientist at Cisco ltd. 
University-wise my main research interests are Machine Learning, Optimization, Deep Learnig, Computational Biology and Computational Genomics.
I currently try to use structure learning algorithms for Probabilistic Graphical Models in order to learn local and global objectives in one learning process.
You can see my constantly changing framework for this project pyMRF.
Industry-wise my research interest lie mainly on anomaly detection problems, and the tools that I use span from basic ML teqhniques down to Variational Autoencoders and other recent Deep Learning models.</p>
