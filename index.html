<h1>Hi there, I'm Elkana Baris!</h1>
<p>A Graduate Student at the Hebrew University and a Machine Learnig practiocioner</p> 
<p>Academic-wise, my research interests are in Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. 
I wish to combine the above with Computational Biology and Computational Genomics.</p>
<p>I currently try to use structure-learning algorithms in Markov Random Fields 
in order to automatically learn soft-constraints for POS tagging.</p>
<p>You can see my constantly updating framework for this project <a href="https://github.com/elkbrsathuji/pyMRF">pyMRF</a>.</p>
<p>Industry-wise, my research experience is:</p>
  <p> - Novel Deep Learning algoritm developement as part of a super-talented team (@Imubit ltd.) </p>
  <p> - User Modeling and Anomaly Detection for identity theft (@Cisco ltd.) </p>
  <p> - Classification for IoT discovery (@Cisco ltd.) </p>
  <p> - Classification for Malware Threats (@Cisco ltd.) </p>
<p> - I love python and friends (Numpy, Scipy, Scikit, TensorFlow, PyTorch)and I love to build robust infrustructure for my research.</p>
<p> I am also a family person, I have one amazing wife and three awesome kids, which are my basically what I live for.</p>
