<h1>Hi there, I'm Elkana Baris!</h1>
<p>I'm a Graduate Student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and also a Data Scientist at Cisco ltd.</p> 
<p>University-wise my main research interests are Machine Learning, Optimization, Deep Learnig, Computational Biology and Computational Genomics.</p>
<p>I currently try to use structure learning algorithms for Probabilistic Graphical Models in order to learn local and global objectives in one learning process.</p>
<p>You can see my constantly changing framework for this project <a href="https://github.com/elkbrsathuji/pyMRF">pyMRF</a>.</p>
<p>Industry-wise my research is mainly onanomaly detection problems, and the tools that I use span from basic ML techniques down to Variational Autoencoders and other recent Deep Learning models.</p>
