<h1>Hi there, I'm Elkana Baris!</h1>
  <h3> I am working on a new cool open-source project, stay tuned, airing soon </h3> 
<p>A Graduate Student at the Hebrew University and a Machine Learnig practictioner</p> 
<p>Academic-wise, my research interests are in Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. 
I deeply wish to combine the above with Computational Biology and Computational Genomics.</p>
<p>My current research effort is to drive expert systems toward general algorithms, which mostly means to encapsulate inductive bias in fancy fashion.</p>
<p>I am using variety of techniques (from structure-learning algorithms in Markov Random Fields to automatic data analysis)
in order to learn soft-constraints for POS tagging, without hard-coding them.</p>
<p>You can see my constantly updating framework for this project <a href="https://github.com/elkbrsathuji/pyMRF">pyMRF</a>.</p>
<p>Industry-wise, my research experience is:</p>
  <p> - Object detection and classification as part of the autonomous vehicle project (@Mobileye). </p>
  <p> - A research project using novel Deep Learning algoritm developement with a super-talented team (@Imubit ltd.) </p>
  <p> - User Modeling and Anomaly Detection for identity theft (@Cisco ltd.) </p>
  <p> - Classification for IoT discovery (@Cisco ltd.) </p>
  <p> - Classification for Malware Threats (@Cisco ltd.) </p>
<p> - I love python and friends (Numpy, Scipy, Scikit, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and I love building robust infrustructure for my research.</p>
<p> I am also a family guy, I have one amazing wife and three awesome kids, which are basically what I live for.</p>
